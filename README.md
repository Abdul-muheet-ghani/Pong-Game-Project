# MERL Course Training v1.0 (Pong-Game-Project)

Welcome to our beginner-friendly course on hardware design and FPGA
programming! This program is tailored for those eager to learn the essentials of
creating hardware designs and effectively porting them onto FPGA (Field
Programmable Gate Array) platforms. Central to this learning experience is the
indispensable role of Lushy Lab, providing a user-friendly VS Code extension that
facilitates seamless hardware design and FPGA testing.

Throughout this course, participants will embark on a comprehensive learning
journey. Starting with the setup of the Lushy Lab extension, learners will progress
through the fundamentals of Digital Logic Design (DLD), gaining a solid foundation
for the subsequent exploration of Verilog, a hardware descriptive language crucial for
expressing complex hardware designs. Moving beyond theory, students will engage
in practical hands-on experiences, crafting their own games from scratch, including
popular titles like Pong. The curriculum also encompasses interfacing with
peripherals like VGA (Video Graphic Array) for screen display and keyboards for user
control.
